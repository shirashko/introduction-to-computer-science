# Introduction-to-Computer-Science
This are the projects I have completed in the course "Introduction to Computer Science" in the "Open Univesity". This course aims to teach fundamental and advanced concepts of Computer Science, introduces the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming, efficiency and data structures. Additional details about the course can be found on this [link](#https://www-e.openu.ac.il/courses/20441.htm).
